# IT-Manifesto https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifesto
WIP: You have stumbled here out of curiousity trying to figure out how to even begin your path through the IT jungle we all live in. Or maybe you thought this place would give you some quick tips and tricks to help you get past the current technical hurdle. These are just a few possibilities of your life choises right now in this digial chaos. In the end, i don't really care. All I care to do right now is to give you (or myself) some kind of roadmap, toolkit, dictionary, manual, cheatsheet, code snipits, and reference material to expand upon. My ultimate goal is to build a repository/system/distribution of all things IT related that might be your best source of "Truth" in this complex world. The goal is to be comprehensive for all skill levels, and still maintain user freiendliness, a combination that will always be challenging. 

TODO: Eventually, the only way to overcome these challenges is to leverage the community for help evolve the sytem so cater to everyone's needs.
