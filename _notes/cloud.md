## AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner Official Practice Question Set

## 1.1 Define the AWS Cloud and its value proposition

### Question 1

**Which of the following are benefits of the AWS Cloud? (Select TWO.)**

A - Companies need increased IT staff.

Incorrect. With the AWS Cloud, you can focus on your customers, rather than on the acquisition, installation, and management of infrastructure. Although the use of AWS services might offload some of the work your IT staff performs, it will not directly increase your IT staff.

B - Capital expenses are replaced with variable expenses.

Correct. With the AWS Cloud, you benefit from Amazon's global purchasing of compute resources. You do not need to invest heavily in data centers.

C - Customers receive the same monthly bill regardless of which resources they use.

Incorrect. With the AWS Cloud, you pay only for the individual services that you need, for as long as you use them. You are not required to commit to a long-term contract.

For more information about flexible pricing on the AWS platform, see AWS Pricing.

D - Companies gain increased agility.

Correct. With the AWS Cloud, you make IT resources available to developers in minutes instead of weeks. The result is reduced cost and time for development, which increases agility.

For more information about agility, see Six Advantages of Cloud Computing.

E - AWS holds responsibility for security in the cloud.

Incorrect. The customer is responsible for security in the AWS Cloud as part of the AWS shared responsibility model.

For more information about security in the AWS Cloud, see Shared Responsibility Model.

#### Question 2

**Which of the following are advantages of the AWS Cloud? (Select TWO.)**

A - AWS manages the maintenance of the cloud infrastructure.

Correct. This solution is an example of security "of" the cloud. AWS is responsible for protecting the infrastructure that runs all of the services offered in the AWS Cloud. This infrastructure is composed of the hardware, software, networking, and facilities that run AWS Cloud services.

For more information about the AWS shared responsibility model, see Shared Responsibility Model.

B - AWS manages the security of applications built on AWS.

Incorrect. This solution is an example of security "in" the cloud. Application security is the customer's responsibility.

For more information about the AWS shared responsibility model, see Shared Responsibility Model.

C - AWS manages capacity planning for physical servers.

Correct. This solution is an example of security "of" the cloud. Capacity planning of the cloud is an inherited control from AWS. AWS purchases additional servers as needed, based on overall customer demand.

For more information about the AWS shared responsibility model, see Shared Responsibility Model.

D - AWS manages the development of applications on AWS.

Incorrect. This solution is an example of security "in" the cloud. AWS does not manage application development.

For more information about the AWS shared responsibility model, see Shared Responsibility Model.

E - AWS manages cost planning for virtual servers.

Incorrect. AWS offers tools to help customers visualize, understand, and manage costs. Customers are responsible for cost planning for their virtual servers.

For more information about cost planning tools, see AWS Cost Explorer.

## 1.2 Identify aspects of AWS Cloud economics

### Question 3

**A company requires physical isolation of its Amazon EC2 instances from the instances of other customers.**

**Which instance purchasing option meets this requirement?**

A - Dedicated Hosts

Correct. With Dedicated Hosts, a physical server is dedicated for your use. Dedicated Hosts provide visibility and the option to control how you place your instances on an isolated, physical server.

For more information about Dedicated Hosts, see Amazon EC2 Dedicated Hosts.

B - Reserved Instances

Incorrect. Reserved Instances are not physical instances. Reserved Instances are a billing discount applied to the use of On-Demand Instances in your account. Reserved Instances do not provide physical workload isolation.

For more information about Reserved Instances, see Reserved Instances.

C - On-Demand Instances

Incorrect. With On-Demand Instances, you pay for compute capacity by the second with no long-term commitments. On-Demand Instances do not provide physical workload isolation.

For more information about On-Demand Instances, see On-Demand Instances.

D - Spot Instances

Incorrect. With Spot Instances, you can take advantage of unused EC2 capacity in the AWS Cloud. Spot Instances do not provide physical workload isolation.

For more information about Spot Instances, see Amazon EC2 Spot Instances.

## 1.3 Explain the different cloud architecture design principles

### Question 4

**Which AWS Cloud architecture principle states that systems should reduce interdependencies?**

A - Scalability

Incorrect. Systems that are scalable can react to increases and decreases in load. Scalability does not reduce interdependencies between system components.

For more information about AWS Cloud best practices, see AWS Well-Architected Framework.

B - Services, not servers

Incorrect. This solution does not reduce interdependencies between system components in an application deployment. However, you still need to design features that are decoupled within the application to reduce single endpoints that can become failures.

For more information about AWS Cloud best practices, see AWS Well-Architected Framework.

C - Automation

Incorrect. Automation can improve stability, efficiency during deployments, and the response to events. However, you still need to design architecture that reduces tight dependencies between the layers of the application.

For more information about AWS Cloud best practices, see AWS Well-Architected Framework.

D - Loose coupling

Correct. Loose coupling helps isolate behavior of a component from other components that depend on it, increasing resiliency and agility. A change or a failure in one of the components should not affect the other components.

For more information about AWS Cloud best practices, see AWS Well-Architected Framework.

### Question 5

Which AWS Cloud architecture design principle supports the distribution of workloads across multiple Availability Zones?

A - Implement automation.

Incorrect. You can use automation services, such as AWS CloudFormation, to deploy resources into one or more Availability Zones. However, the implementation of automation is not directly tied to, or limited to, the distribution of workloads across multiple Availability Zones.

For more information about CloudFormation, see AWS CloudFormation FAQs.

B - Design for agility.

Incorrect. When you design for agility, you can provision resources more quickly. Agility is not related to the number of Availability Zones.

For more information about agility, see Risk is Lack of Agility.

C - Design for failure.

Correct. AWS recommends that you distribute workloads across multiple Availability Zones. This distribution will ensure continuous availability of your application, even if the application is unavailable in one single Availability Zone.

For more information about the performance efficiency pillar, see Performance Efficiency Pillar - AWS Well-Architected Framework.

D - Implement elasticity.

Incorrect. Elasticity is the ability to activate resources as you need them and return resources when you no longer need them. Elasticity is not related to the number of Availability Zones.

For more information about elasticity, see Elasticity.

## 2.1 Define the AWS shared responsibility model

### Question 6

**Which of the following is a responsibility of AWS under the AWS shared responsibility model?**

A - Design a customer's application for disaster recovery.

Incorrect. AWS offers many services to help with disaster recovery and business continuity planning. However, according to the shared responsibility model, it is the customerâ€™s responsibility to decide which services it needs.

For more information about the shared responsibility model, see Shared Responsibility Model.

B - Update the guest operating systems on deployed Amazon EC2 instances.

Incorrect. The customer must manage its own updates on its provisioned infrastructure.

For more information about the shared responsibility model, see Shared Responsibility Model.

C - Configure new resources within an AWS account.

Incorrect. The customer decides which services to use and how to use them.

For more information about the shared responsibility model, see Shared Responsibility Model.

D  - Secure the physical infrastructure.

Correct. AWS fully maintains the physical controls.

For more information about the shared responsibility model, see Shared Responsibility Model.

## 2.2 Define AWS Cloud security and compliance concepts

### Question 7

**Which of the following describes a security best practice that can be implemented by using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)?**

A - Turn off AWS Management Console access for all users.

Incorrect. There could be legitimate requirements for certain IAM users to have access to the console. Consequently, to turn off access for all users is not the correct solution.

For more information about best practices for securing an AWS account, see What are some best practices for securing my AWS account and its resources?

B - Generate secret keys for every IAM user.

Incorrect. This solution would generate secret keys for IAM users and would require them to access their applications through programmatic access.

For more information about best practices for securing an AWS account, see What are some best practices for securing my AWS account and its resources?

C - Grant permissions to users who are required to perform a specific task only.

Correct. Through the security recommendation of least privilege, an IAM best practice is to grant granular permissions to users by using IAM roles.

For more information about IAM best practices and least privilege, see Grant least privilege.

For more information about best practices for securing an AWS account, see What are some best practices for securing my AWS account and its resources?

D - Store AWS credentials within Amazon EC2 instances.

Incorrect. The solution to store credentials within EC2 instances is not a security best practice. It would be a better security practice to use IAM roles to grant permissions to EC2 instances, because the IAM roles will rotate the credentials automatically.

For more information about best practices for securing an AWS account, see What are some best practices for securing my AWS account and its resources?

### Question 8

A company needs to monitor and receive alerts about AWS Management Console sign-in events that involve the AWS account root user.

Which AWS service can the company use to meet these requirements?

A - Amazon CloudWatch

Correct. CloudWatch monitors your AWS resources and the applications that you run on AWS in real time. You can use CloudWatch to monitor and receive alerts about console sign-in events that involve the AWS account root user.

For more information about CloudWatch, see What is Amazon CloudWatch?

B - AWS Config

Incorrect. You can use AWS Config to assess, audit, and evaluate the configurations of your AWS resources. AWS Config cannot alert you about console sign-in events that involve the AWS account root user.

For more information about AWS Config, see What is AWS Config?

C - AWS Trusted Advisor

Incorrect. You can use Trusted Advisor for real-time guidance to help you provision your resources according to AWS best practices. Trusted Advisor cannot alert you about console sign-in events that involve the AWS account root user.

For more information about Trusted Advisor, see AWS Trusted Advisor.

D - AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)

Incorrect. With IAM, you can manage access to AWS services and resources securely. IAM cannot alert you about console sign-in events that involve the AWS account root user.

For more information about IAM, see AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM).

## 2.3 Identify AWS access management capabilities

### Question 9

**A company has an application server that runs on an Amazon EC2 instance. The application server needs to access contents within a private Amazon S3 bucket.**

**What is the recommended approach to meet this requirement?**

A - Create an IAM role with the appropriate permissions. Associate the role with the EC2 instance.

Correct. IAM roles are temporary credentials that expire. IAM roles are more secure than long-term access keys because they reduce risk if credentials are accidentally exposed.

For more information about IAM roles, see Using an IAM role to grant permissions to applications running on Amazon EC2 instances.

B - Configure a VPC peering connection to allow private communication between the EC2 instance and the S3 bucket.

Incorrect. A VPC peering connection is a networking connection between two VPCs that enables you to route traffic between them by using private IPv4 addresses or IPv6 addresses. VPC peering connections cannot connect a VPC and an S3 bucket.

For more information about VPC peering, see What is VPC peering?

C - Create a shared access key. Configure the EC2 instance to use the hardcoded key.

Incorrect. The creation of a shared key is not a best practice because this reduces the value of auditing AWS resource access. It is not a best practice to embed access keys into the application code because application code can become compromised.

For more information about managing access keys, see Best practices for managing AWS access keys.

D - Configure the application to read an access key from a secured source.

Incorrect. It is a best practice to use IAM roles instead of long-term access keys. Long-term access keys, such as those associated with IAM users and AWS account root users, remain valid until you manually revoke them. However, temporary security credentials that are obtained through IAM roles and other features of AWS Security Token Service (AWS STS) expire after a short period of time. Use temporary security credentials to help reduce the risk in case credentials are accidentally exposed.

For more information about managing access keys, see Best practices for managing AWS access keys.

## 2.4 Identify resources for security support

### Question 10

Which security-related services or features does AWS offer? (Select TWO.)

For more information about penetration testing, see Penetration Testing.

E - Amazon S3 copyrighted content detection

Incorrect. AWS provides copyrighted content detection.

### Question 11

**Which recommendations are included in the AWS Trusted Advisor checks? (Select TWO.)**

A - Amazon S3 bucket permissions

Correct. Trusted Advisor checks for S3 bucket permissions in Amazon S3 with open access permissions. Bucket permissions that grant list access to everyone can result in higher than expected charges if objects in the bucket are listed by unintended users at a high frequency. Bucket permissions that grant upload and delete access to all users create potential security vulnerabilities by allowing anyone to add, modify, or remove items in a bucket. This Trusted Advisor check examines explicit bucket permissions and associated bucket policies that might override the bucket permissions.

For more information about S3 bucket permissions, see AWS Trusted Advisor best practice checklist.

B - AWS service outages for services

Incorrect. Trusted Advisor does not provide notifications for service outages. You can use the AWS Personal Health Dashboard to learn about AWS Health events that can affect your AWS services or account.

For more information about the Personal Health Dashboard, see Getting started with the AWS Personal Health Dashboard.

C - Multi-factor authentication (MFA) use on the AWS account root user

A - Multiple Availability Zones in an AWS Region

Incorrect. Availability Zones are one or more discrete data centers with redundant power, networking, and connectivity in a Region. When infrastructure is deployed across multiple Availability Zones, you can achieve a highly available deployment within the geographical location of the Region. However, this solution does not provide global deployments.

For more information about Availability Zones, see Global Infrastructure.

B - Multiple AWS Regions

Correct. A Region is a physical location where there are clusters of AWS data centers. AWS offers many different Regions where you can deploy infrastructure around the world. With the use of multiple Regions, you can achieve a global deployment of compute, storage, and databases.

For more information about Regions, see Global Infrastructure.

C - Tags

Incorrect. Tags are metadata that you can associate with AWS resources. Tags are user-defined data in the form of key-value pairs. You can use tags to manage, identify, organize, search for, and filter resources. Tags do not provide global deployments of applications and solutions.

For more information about tags, see Tagging AWS resources.

D - Resource groups

Incorrect. AWS Resource Groups is a service that you can use to manage and automate tasks on many resources at the same time. Resources in AWS are entities such as Amazon EC2 instances and Amazon S3 buckets. With Resource Groups, you can filter resources based on tags or AWS CloudFormation stacks and then perform an action against a group of resources. You do not use Resource Groups to deploy AWS resources globally.

For more information about resource groups, see What are AWS Resource Groups?

### Question 14

**Which AWS services or features support data replication across AWS Regions? (Select TWO.)**

A - Amazon S3

Correct. Amazon S3 supports Cross-Region Replication. With Cross-Region Replication, you designate a destination S3 bucket in another Region. When Cross-Region Replication is turned on, any new object that is uploaded will be replicated to the destination S3 bucket.
