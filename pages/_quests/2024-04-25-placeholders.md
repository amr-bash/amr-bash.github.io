Building templates for your content is a great way to ensure consistency across your site. Front Matter makes it easy to create placeholders for your content. Placeholders are a way to define a template for your content. When you create a new page, the placeholders are automatically filled in with the default values you specify. This makes it easy to create new content without having to worry about formatting or structure.
